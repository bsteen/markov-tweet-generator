## Team Members: 
Casey Campbell, Miguel Hernandez, and Benjamin Steenkamer
## Project Description
(Due December 13th) (no red-team)  
The task is to take in sample text and generate a tweet (280 characters) in the style of that text using Markov Chains.
For super-extra credit consume a user name from Twitter and grab some tweets by the person as your source material.  
This needs to be installed: `pip install tweepy`
