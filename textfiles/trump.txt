I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and ‚Äúpapers‚Äù should do the same with their Fake News!
The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He‚Äôs not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again
So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the ‚Äúunsolved mystery‚Äù that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!

Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for ‚Äúinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.‚Äù But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack‚Äôs past!
Great, and we should boycott Fake News CNN. Dealing with them is a total waste of time! 
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
Wow, even I didn‚Äôt realize we did so much. Wish the Fake News would report! Thank you.
One of the most accurate polls last time around. But #FakeNews likes to say we‚Äôre in the 30‚Äôs. They are wrong. Some people think numbers could be in the 50's. Together, WE will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control!At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up.

The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That‚Äôs almost as bad as kneeling! When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!.....
Marshawn Lynch of the NFL‚Äôs Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.
Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country. No leadership in NFL!
Too much talk, not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem.
The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!
It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY
Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!
Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!
The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!
The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country. #StandForOurAnthemüá∫üá∏
PM General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie!
NFLplayer PatTillman joined U.S. Army in 2002. He was killed in action 2004. He fought 4our country/freedom. #StandForOurAnt‚Ä¶
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
@realDonaldTrump You can boycott our anthem WE CAN BOYCOTT YOU! #NFL #MAGA
NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.
Despite the constant negative press covfefe.
Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault
