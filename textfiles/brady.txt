A lightly regarded prospect coming out of college,[52][53] Brady was selected by the New England Patriots with the 199th overall pick in the sixth round of 2000 NFL Draft and has since spent his entire 18-season career with the Patriots. Since Brady became their starting quarterback in 2001, the Patriots have never had a losing season and have won 14 division titles. The Patriots played in eleven AFC Championship Games from 2001 to 2016—including six in a row from 2011 to 2016—and won seven of them. Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have combined to form the most successful quarterback-head coach tandem in NFL history, winning more regular season games and postseason games than any other such duo [54] as well as appearing in seven Super Bowls. All of these events set new NFL records.[55]

In his second season, Brady took over as the starting quarterback after Drew Bledsoe was injured.[56] He led the Patriots to first place in the AFC East[57] and a victory over the favored St. Louis Rams[58][59] in Super Bowl XXXVI, winning his first Super Bowl MVP award. Despite the Patriots' missing the playoffs the following season, Brady would then lead them to back-to-back World Championships in 2003 and 2004, winning Super Bowl MVP honors again in 2003. Along the way, the Patriots won an NFL-record 21 consecutive games (including the playoffs) between the 2003 and 2004 seasons.[60] The 2005 season was Brady's first to throw for 4,000 yards and lead the NFL in passing.[61] That postseason, Brady would win his 10th consecutive playoff game, another NFL postseason record.[62]

Although Brady and the Patriots continued to win often, they did not return to the Super Bowl until the 2007 season. That year, Brady not only set an NFL record with 50 touchdown passes[63] but he would also lead the Patriots to a 16–0 finish,[64] the first perfect regular-season record since the Miami Dolphins finished 14-0 in 1972.[65][66] Brady would win his first career NFL MVP Award, winning 49 out of 50 votes.[67] The Associated Press also named him Male Athlete of the Year, the first such award given to an NFL player since Joe Montana won it in 1989 and 1990.[68] However, the Patriots suffered their first Super Bowl loss with Brady as quarterback, dropping a 17-14 decision to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII.[69]

Brady missed virtually the entire following season due to a knee injury in the season opener.[70] But he would come back strong in the 2009 season to be named the league's Comeback Player of the Year.[71] In 2010, Brady set the NFL record for consecutive passes without an interception (358)[72] and broke his own record for the highest season touchdown to interception ratio (among players who have started a full season) at 9:1, currently the third best TD:INT ratio for a single season by a quarterback.[73] Brady would win his second league MVP award with all 50 votes in his favor.[74] He was the first unanimous NFL MVP since Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor won the award in 1986.[75] He and Joe Montana are the only players in NFL history to win multiple NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards.[76][77] Brady was also named the top player by his peers in the first NFL Top 100 list, released in 2011.[78]

In the 2011 season, Brady led the Patriots to their first AFC Championship since 2007 and appeared in the Super Bowl for a fifth time; but the Patriots would lose again to the Giants.[79] Following AFC Championship Game losses in the following seasons (2012 and 2013), Brady and the Patriots made their sixth trip to the Super Bowl after the 2014 season (Brady's 15th as a professional). There, he led the Patriots to a fourth-quarter comeback [80] over the defending champion Seattle Seahawks. He would lift his fourth Super Bowl trophy (the Patriots' first in ten seasons) and was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time.[81]

Despite missing the first four games of the 2016 season, Brady would lead the Patriots (3-1 before he rejoined them)[82] to win 11 out of the 12 remaining regular season games and two postseason games to make his seventh and most recent Super Bowl appearance. Brady and the Patriots would overcome a 25-point deficit against the Atlanta Falcons (down 28-3 in the third quarter) to force the first overtime in Super Bowl history, winning 34-28 to give Brady his fifth Super Bowl title.[83] He earned his fourth Super Bowl MVP award after setting title-game records for appearances, pass attempts, completions, passing yards and fourth-quarter comebacks.[84]

Over his career, Brady has won two league MVP awards, five Super Bowls, and four Super Bowl MVP Awards. A 12-time Pro Bowler, Brady has also twice led the NFL in passing yardage[85][86]. As of November 2017, he currently owns the third-highest career passer rating (97.9) among quarterbacks with at least 1,500 career passing attempts.[87] He has thrown for more passing yards and touchdowns than any quarterback in NFL postseason history; he also has won more playoff games than any other quarterback. As a result of his highly successful career, Brady is rated among the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[88]
