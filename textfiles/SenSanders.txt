Republicans cannot ignore millions of older workers who are about to lose the pensions they were promised, younger people burdened with outrageous levels of student debt or veterans unable to get the quality health care they were promised.
Republicans cannot ignore the reality that 800,000 Dreamers will start losing their legal status in a few months.
Republicans cannot ask for $54 billion more in military spending, and ignore the health care needs of our children and working families in the CHIP and Community Health Center programs.
The Republicans, who control the Senate, House and White House, must not be allowed to shut down the government. They must work in a bipartisan way to pass a budget which reflects the needs of all Americans, not just wealthy campaign contributors.
Buried in the Republican tax plan are hidden provisions designed to stick it to the poor and working class while the rich and corporations get billions of dollars in breaks. https://t.co/b5vvNogzBZ

It needs to be an ongoing movement of women and men that includes a national discussion about sexism, sexual harassment, objectification, inequality and abuse of power.

Trickle-down economics failed under Ronald Reagan, under George W. Bush and in the state of Kansas under Gov. Brownback. It is a fraudulent theory cooked up by think tanks funded by the wealthy.
When Reagan slashed taxes for the rich in 1981, economic growth went down by 1.9% the following year and the unemployment rate increased. The 1981 tax cut was so "successful" that Reagan had to increase taxes 11 times after that.
The bottom line: the American people do not want us to pass tax breaks for billionaires today and they certainly don’t want us to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
